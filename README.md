## Installation

1. Open your currently active profile folder
    1. In the URL bar type: `about:profiles`
    2. Look for the profile which has the "Default Profile" property set to true
    3. Click on "Open Folder" button belonging to the "Root Directory" property
2. Create a new folder named chrome
3.  - Clone the theme directly into the chrome folder. If you choose this method you will be able to update the theme by pulling the latest files.  
      OR
    - Download and extract the files in the chrome folder
4. If you're running Firefox 69+
    1. In the URL bar type: `about:config`
    2. You will receive a warning to proceed with caution. Accept the Risk and Continue.
    3. In the "Search preference name" input field type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`
    4. Set it to true by double clicking the false value
5. Restart the browser

## Custom styling

The theme comes **as is** but it can be extended using CSS files provided in the custom folder. Further extensions should be included in the same folder to keep the main theme consistent.
To **enable** custom styles, copy and paste the following `@import` statements at the end of the `userChrome.css` file.

### Re-enable title bar controls (MIN-MAX-CLOSE buttons)

For Windows (enabled by default):

```css
@import "custom/_titlebar-controls-enable-windows.css";
```

For macOS:

```css
@import "custom/_titlebar-controls-enable-macos.css";
```

### Disable megabar behavior

```css
@import "custom/_megabar-disable.css";
```

## Disabling fork additions
Certain additions in this fork can be disabled through slight modifiations in the files.

### Disable auto-hiding URL bar
Comment out or delete the following line in `userChrome.css`:
```css
@import '_navigation-bar-hide.css';
```
### Disable favicon as close button
Comment out or delete the following line in `userChrome.css`:
```css
@import '_favicon-close.css';

### Remove left padding on tab bar

#TabsToolbar {
    padding: 0px 125px 0px 25px !important;
}
```

## Support
There is a fair chance you'll come across bugs or mistakes as I don't know CSS, I haven't read the docs for custom CSS in Firefox, and I haven't read all of the origial code. Because the bugs are
likely my fault, please report them to me rather than upstream and I will try my best to fix them.

### Known Bugs
- Tab bar does not hide when in fullscreen
